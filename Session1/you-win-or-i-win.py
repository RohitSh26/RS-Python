# import random library/ package
import random

# get a random number by calling randint method from random package
# randint is a method that Return random integer in range [a, b], including both end points.
randomNumber = random.randint(1, 1000)

# Now we print out rando, number
print(f"Generated Random Number is {randomNumber}")

# add logic to compare if numner is even or odd
# if number is even, print "You win" otherwise print "I Win"

# you can use modulo (%) operator to find if number is divisible by 2
# a number is divisible by 2 it is even
# use can use modulo operator to check if number is even or odd
# a % b gives you remainder when you divide a by b

this code will help you to come with your answer.

if a % b == 0:
    print("I win")
else:
    print("You win")
